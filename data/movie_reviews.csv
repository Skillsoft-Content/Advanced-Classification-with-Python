reviews
Just saw the movie this evening. Who knew Bradley Cooper could sing! Loved it from beginning to end.
This movie was so awesome and sad!!! Be prepared to cry your eyes out!
"While it did not exactly follow the original, the underlying love story and emotional engagement was spot on."
Better than I imagined it would be.
This body of work is phenomenal. Bravo! Best movie of the year.
"Greatly ******* this remake with its own direction. The music was great and the emotions were heart felt thru out. great directing, acting and singing."
Lady Gaga put on. Great Performance she showed how talented she really is and Bradley Cooper crafted a very well executed motion picture!
What a great movie!! It deserves an Oscar on so many different levels. Lady Gaga was amazing! Its a must see movie!
This movie was beyond Amazing! I would recommend everyone to go see it!! The chemistry between Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga was on point! I loved the movie and would pay to see it again!
A great story with great acting.
Amazing
Lady Gaga is fantastic and so beautiful! Bradley Cooper was surprisingly good with his singing! Sam Elliott always is awesome !
It's so many things going on all at once and at the same time you are still processing the next day. I'm already planning on seeing it again just to soak it all in.
This one just grabs your soul in all the right places. Wow. Stunning performances from Bradley Cooper & Lady Gaga.
"Best acting, storyline, music....Bradley Cooper and Gaga were so believable and knocked it out of the park. A must see!"
"The movie captures PERFECTLY, how you meet someone, and they are a stranger to you, but your energies have already fused at some cosmic level, and all you want to do is touch them somehow to fuse with them on the earthly plane. And all the adorable awkwardness that goes with those tentative early moments. And it doesn't hurt that Cooper and Gaga have mad crazy chemistry. Great music too. Surprised at how good this was."
A must see. I got chills when Bradly Cooper sang. Lady Gaga gave an amazing performance. I was blown away by all of it. Bring tissues.
Wow. Just wow.
Bradley Cooper is definatly getting a oscars or two for this one. Lady Gaga was also incredible!
"Ghurl, ghurl, ghurrrrrlll. Amazing!"
"The music and story hits right at the heart of you. I wanted to be critical but instead I will say allow yourself to feel and enjoy, sing along and be moved by their love."
Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga were mesmerizing on screen. You could feel their love and could feel their pain. Who knew Bradley had that much talent. He was totally believable as a country music star. I'm infatuated with Charlie the dog.
"From the start it was apparent that this was a newer version but still had the same overall storyline. Within the first 10 minutes, an homage to Janet ****** in the first ASIB, and throughout the film one can see subtle homages given to Judy garland as well as Barbra Streisand. The acting was brilliant. Amazing to see supporting cast members from the world of comedy such as Andrew dice Clay and Dave Chappell and of course the famous drag queens Shangela Laquifa Wadley and Willam Belli. Each character was fully developed and fit perfectly with each other. The cinematography gave the viewer a sense of being present and fully surrounded by the energy that was on the screen in one moment and then pulled you back as if you were a person peering in on dark secrets that you could not pull yourself away from hearing. This was a very good adaptation. I will not call it a remake since so much has been created to reflect our times. The music is brilliant and will stick in your head for days."
"What a great movie. Good acting, singing and great story line. The cast was incredible. I can see Lady Gaga getting a lot more acting roles in her future. Sam Elliott gets better looking with age and Bradley Cooper,,,,,wow!"
"This movie is absolutely over the moon! 5 Stars. 2 Thumbs Up. And knock your socks off performance. Congratulations to Bradley Cooper, Lady Gaga and the entire cast & crew. Believing that Oscar will come knocking on your door!! Bravo. Bravo. Bravo! And cheers to All!"
"Best movie Ive seen in years! They were BOTH SO AWESOME. Definitely Academy Award material. Bradley Cooper HAS to win EVERYTHING! Sam Elliot is again AMAZING. Lady Gaga was just PERFECT. I loved seeing HER! Not the souped up,made up woman were used to seeing. She was so believable. Her sheer joy in singing was beautiful to see. Great acting for a newbie"
"I have to say it was absolutely amazing, and mind blowing. There was so much emotion in the movie and love. just wow!"
"The acting and the music were superb. I know very little about Lady Gaga but I'm thoroughly intrigued by her now. She blew me away. Bradley Cooper was very convincing in his role, too. I highly recommend this movie."
Wonderful movie. Love the changes Would see it another time
"For once, the movie lived up to the ************. Gaga was perfection, no surprise. She breathes perfection. I wonder why Bradley Cooper hasnt been asked to portray a singer like this before. The man has (until now) a hidden talent. I see a Directors oscar, as well as acting for both of these two!!"
Great story. Acting was so good. Bradley Cooper did a great job as Producer.
"So raw and pure. I had such a great time watching this at the theaters! I was glued to the screen. Very emotional throughout, audience laughed and cried from start to end! I recommend this movie and suggest you watch it ASAP! So proud of GaGa and Bradley! Go watch it!"
"I very much ******* this movie. I only knew that Colette was a French writer from the 1800's, Learning this true story was eye-opening. And the acting, cinematography and writing were superb. I highly recommend this film for both men and women. Not for children."
Was expecting better
"Really wanted to like it, usually like period pieces. This was so boring; people were walking out."
Movie about about messed up ****** perverts.
"Loved it! An inspiration for all struggling writers, to keep on. Talent wins out. Despite the culture predators like Wily, whose modern counterparts are no less active. Keira Knightly was magnicent, despite being a smidge too old to play a teenage Collette."
Will see it again !
Too long too slow and too boring
We ******* everything about the movie. Well done!
"The story of her early life was so interesting and and this portrayal is pretty accurate. Scenes and music are gorgeous! In the beginning it struck me as odd that they all spoke with British accents, since this takes place in France, but it didn't detract from the movie."
"Collette is a charming story of a talented woman author trying to discover who she is, in all respects. At first she succeeds through her husband's resources, but that isn't enough, and she goes for more. The visuals are very well done, and th einteractions of th etalented cast are quite believable"
"This movie started off good, but took a turn I was not expected. I was not as impressed as I had hoped I would be. I would t recommend it to friends."
An unexpectedly riveting experience that keeps you wanting more.

"The story of her early life was so interesting and and this portrayal is pretty accurate. Scenes and music are gorgeous! In the beginning it struck me as odd that they all spoke with British accents, since this takes place in France, but it didn't detract from the movie."
One of Knightleu's best performances to date. She gave such a fierce portrayal of a brilliant woman. Fall in Love with hey all over again each time I see her on film. so glad she does these period pieces (which she said she prefers) - she does them great justice.
"I loved this movie especially the fact that Colette takes on the challenge to help her husband as a ghostwriter and does exceedingly well with the sale of the books as times goes by. Her husband becomes greedy, possessive, controlling, and it is never enough for him. He wants more and more from her. Finally, Colette wakes up and realizes she needs to do her own thing in life and moves on. She finds much success in the various ventures she embarks on. Kudos to her. Great movie."
"A very interesting story and we knew none of it. As always, Kiera is really great as is Dominic West. Audience at Paris was sold out and loved it. I say go, tho not the greatest movie of all time."
"I loved this movie, Keira's performance was excellent, she must be nominated for Oscar, it is so sad, very few movie theaters show this movie even though it is one of the few very good movies comes once in a while. I guess the weirdest thing was for actors to speak in english, the actors must have had their minds crossed living in france and speaking in English, but it did not distract me watching the movie. This is a must go movie, highly recommend."
"So great! Intrical relationships, delightfully complex and personal without being pretentious. Definitely would recommend."
"The story, the costumes, the locations and the script all come together so nicely in an interesting story. A story that makes you care about the characters and the lessons life is throwing their way."
"Keria Knightly was superb, the scenery was beautiful and I throughly ******* the movie"
It waw everything I remembered from
"The first half is beautiful, exciting, dramatic and capturing. The second half, tends to drag a little and become ***********. Overall it is a well done movie with the story of a great writer who gets tired of being a ******. My rating is between 3.5 and 4 stars."
As much as I wanted to love this film and as wonderful an actress that Keira Knightly is the film was disappointing. The movie dragged on and I could not wait till the end.
"Crazy Rich Asians is funny, clever, filled with intrigue, and cinematically BEAUTIFUL to watch. It reminds me a lot of My Big Fat Greek Wedding... but on a completely different socioeconomic tier! Awkwafina steals every single scene she is in. Go see this movie and support more diversely cast projects in Hollywood!"
This a fun and endearing movie. That shows some of the many misunderstood traditions and stereo types and sheds light on the humorous side of life in the Asian world .
A must read series and a MUST watch movie
Awesome movie.
I was excited to see this and it lived up to my expectations. It was funny and clever and I loved it!
Phenomenal??????????
Loved it!!!
Such a great movie one of those movies where you could watch it at any part when it's on TV and you'll just sit down and watch in the wedding scene was so beautiful
Amazing movie omg had me and tears and laughter
"This movie is highly entertaining, captivating storytelling. And it is extremely important for everyone to watch. There needs to be a second and third movie."
"Such a great movie and made me so proud to be Asian! I laughed, I cried, and laughed and cried at the same time...great feel good movie you don't wanna miss!"
What an amazing movie! The cast was amazing and the ending... WOW!
Laughed and cried - great love story.
"This was a cute romantic comedy. The skyline was Singapore was beautiful and breathtaking. The fashions were gorgeous, too. Caught up in the universal rich boy poor girl universal story line, it was easy to forget the cast was all Asian."
"Its like a korean drama, but chinese and with ACTUAL KISSING"
"Very good movie, with a good plot. Love the cast."
I felt like I had a true cinematic experience. I will definitely be going to this movie again.
Love everything about this movie!
"Loved this movie, same story but seeing it through a another culture was what made this movie delightful and insightful. ??"
Must watch!!
Great cast. The comedy bits is a nice touch. Definitely a good watch
This is an amazing movie 10/10!!!
We loved this movie!! Great acting! Great story!! A good peek at the Asian culture which was really fun! Must see!!!
(B) 7/10
"We really ******* this movie, from start to finish it kept our interest. It was funny and sad in some parts. The scenery was outstanding and acting superb! I think any age would enjoy this movie!"
"A funny, cute movie."
This movie was funny and took a fresh approach to the romcom format. Beautiful scenery and a great time!
"This movie gave it all....funny, sad, customs verses love and then heart warming. I would recommend seeing it."
"Just with the first scene, the movie gets your attention. The actors were splendid, and the direction, visuals, cinematography, screenplay all were a feast for different senses. It's a really well made rom-com! I'm ****** I missed the mid-credit scene so now I'm contemplating seeing the movie again. I also can't wait to own this on dvd/Netflix... it's that good!"
"Surprisingly solid movie with characters that one can relate too (even if the obscene wealth makes it almost seem like you wouldnt be able too). Rachel, ****** by Constance Wu, is your everyday, strong, brilliant character that has given younger generations someone to look up too, someone to strive to be like."
Contrived. Cast is refreshing to see together. One small step for mankind.
"One of the most original movies I've seen in years but will become a *******! Hilarious and heart felt, as well as excellent story and insight into the culture! A must see (multiple times)!"

"BY LINDAFOLEY75 WRITTEN AUGUST 19, 2018"
The movie had a good plot.
I laughed a lot more than I thought I would! It was really good!
Loved this movie! It did not disappoint compared to descriptions in the book. Beautiful! My husband and 14 year old daughter really ******* as well.
All around pleasing funny movie
So freaking funny
it's a must see with family and friends.
funny parts but overall so-so.
Best movie really hilarious
"Right blend of humor, knowledge, and entertainment."
"The move was an eye-opener. This movie teaches you to never give up and to keep pushing no matter what's your situation. Be true to yourself, be kind to yourself, and always love yourself first. You never get pleasure for revenge no matter how sweet it may be. In life, you will get a chance to sit at all sides of the table. The movie is age appropriate for all. You are never too old to learn a valuable lesson."
Great
Very informative into learning disabilities with humor.
Hilarious. Was laughing the whole way through very very good movie it was enjoyable
I WANT TO MEET KEVIN HEART!!!!! HES AMAZING
Not the greatest comedy in the world but definitely entertaining!
Was laughing all the way through!!!
Coolest comedy movie ever . I really did enjoy the movie
I liked the fact there was comedy yet meaning and an opportunity for Tiffany haddish to play a more serious role. Some things were expected but some came off as a surprise however the shock value was extremely limited
"We loved not only Kevin, but we loved the entire casting crew."
Movie was funny but moved a little slow. Still mAde for an enjoyable evening.
Was not what I was expecting! Not nearly as funny as I thought.
A great comedy... the whole theater was laughing
This was not that impressive for me. Some of the slapstick were funny but over all nothing to tell my friends about.
The movie wasnt that funny. It had moments but Kevin Hart plays the same character in each movie.
I didn't really care for the movie wish I had waited to see it!
It was funny but definitely something I could've waited to see when it hit Netflix lol.
Very funny. I ******* the movie. I will recommend
This movie was great! I think its his funniest to date.
"This movie was so funny, it had me laughing so hard i had to get my breathe. Also was a message in the movie. To never give up on yourself or your goals and dreams. Great job Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish"
Couldn't stop laughing the whole way through.
The movie was really good
Not the best!
I thought I was gonna be funnier . It kind of get bored half way . Plot is the same ********** subject .
Good and funny movie
"Hilariously funny, Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish are great. best movie this year."
"the movie was great, laughed throughout the entire movie"
Scary/ Demonic
"The movie is just dumb, yes a lot of jump scares, but really easy to prevail over the nun..."
love the story line and how everything ties together.
A great addition to the Conjuring franchise. Jump scares and story are worth watching again.
Holly mother of great movies! The acting got me hypnotized in horror!
A great addition to the Conjuring franchise. Jump scares and story are worth watching again.
Holly mother of great movies! The acting got me hypnotized in horror!
The movie was really good. The only downfall of the movie is they had some SERIOUS technical problems before and DURING the show.
Mehhhhy
This movie is definitely worth the hype. It was scary
The conjuring had me more shook
"One of the best horror movies I've seen in a while. Hands down a very chilling, scary movie! The way it should be"
"Definitely not your normal ""Conjuring"" type film. Alot of pop scares throughout but interesting story line. Pretty slow at the beginning and a little drawn out at times but overall, good movie."
it was scary
It wasn't as scary as I expected it to be. All in all a solid film I would recommend others to see it
THIS MOVIE ROCKED MY EFFING PANTS OFF. THIS $#!+ WAS BOMB AS ****
Definitely the weakest of the series.
I love how these movies follow with the previous! definitely a good movie!! must see!!
"As a frequent scary movie goer I thought the scares were predictable, but I loved how everything connects together in the end."
"I liked the movie, I mean it was a typical horror flick however if u have followed the stories it does show where it all came from. I don't get scared and actually jumped once. Kids (13) loved it and were scared."
Not scary. Not even noisy. Best part was the scene where the heroin was getting undressed while praying; that was hot but stopped at her should blaze?! Wtf!
I did like how it made full circle with all the conjuring series.
Took one of my grandkids to see this movie and its one of the best movies that I have seen in a long time it was a really feel good movie excellent presentation funny and wish there would be more movies like this come out for family members and even grandmas to see excellent job on the movie I pray more of these movies come out rather than the horrible ugly nasty movies
I took my grandaughters (age 6) to see this movie and it kept their attention the whole time. It has a lesson about everyone learning from each other even if you speak a different language and learning that it is possible to get along. Good show with beautiful colored scenes.
"This was a pretty decent film. It was funny, had some laughs that adults get (and kids laugh too), and kept you entertained... it's a movie you wouldn't mind seeing again..."
The songs are catchy. It's a cute movie to see with the family. I wouldn't read too much into it. I don't know why people are nitpicking or making out that it teaches kids to not listen to their parents. My son is very self aware and mature and he didn't get that as a take away after watching it. He said it had the same feel to Hotel Transylvania and just ******* watching it.
The kids loved it
"Disappointed 3-D version was sold out. Although entertaining and nice graphics, the standard version of this movie lacked pizzazz. Our 6-year-old grandson rated it a seven out of 10 the 8-year-old grandson gave it a five."
"We took our grandkids and they loved it! In fact, we ALL loved it. I would recommend this movie to everyone."
It is a fantastic movie for the entire family!
it was a great movie
It brought out the kid in me and I could not stop myself from smiling ear to ear. So many catchy songs through out the movie. This movie was about outsiders who arent excepted at first and in the end they came together. Just over all a beautiful story.
"THIs movie was great for all ages. Deep message of unity and acceptance and stereotypes that could apply to any human interactions in the 21st century. ******* recipe, nothing incredibly original but if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it! These ******* recipes work very well and the music and lyrical rap is genuine and helps engage all ages to think about the moral to the story. Kids maybe below 8 will understand on a more simple level while kids 10 and up and adults can apply themes across more complex levels. It's for everyone."
This was an adorable and funny movie. The entire family loved it.
Awesome movie!
Excellent movie
"An upbeat movie that deals with prejudice in a cool funny way. The music is great, fun upbeat movie for the whole family. . Cant imagine anyone not walking out of the movie without a smile or getting the message of tolerance, that is something the world needs more of . Highly recommend"
"It was entertaining, and I loved the positive message it was sending."
Loved the message this movie taught. Very uplifting and inspirational - our littlest granddaughter (4 yo) wants to go see it again and again !!!!
This was a super awesome movie! Great message in a really cute storyline! My grand daughters and I laughed through the whole movie ! Super cute!
"Definitely enjoy tDefinihe movie, my 4 year old really liked it, she ****** put through the movie Definitely adding it to our collection."
I loved it! It was super cute and my children ******* the songs!!
Moral of story it had a good theme. Worth it. Communication is key!
Great kid movie
"Disappointed 3-D version was sold out. Although entertaining and nice graphics, the standard version of this movie lacked pizzazz. Our 6-year-old grandson rated it a seven out of 10 the 8-year-old grandson gave it a five."
It is a fantastic movie for the entire family!

"I really did not like this movie at all. The singing made no sense, the characters were not cute and it was a little boring. The story itself was ok, but very poorly executed. Sad. I was hoping for something so much better!"
My kids and I really ******* it. Great soundtrack and funny scenes!
My granddaughters were so excited to see this movie and they weren't disappointed!
"We had to see it at a different time than we planned, but Small Foot is an adorable movie that has great character development and a plot that has a morality lesson. Colorful, full of action and song, and great for the whole family! We loved it!"
"Not much of a storyline, pretty boring"
The movie was awesome!! Rotten tomato critics are not to be trusted.
Great awesome movie. The money was worth the ticket cost of my D- box seat while I was bored and waiting for idk nothing just ******* the movie and suggest anybody looking for a movie to watch do the same.
"The best Marvel movie yet, love the slight humor venom is capable of."
Awesome!!!
Me gusto bastante entretenido. Adoro a ******** williams y me gusto la actuación de Tom Hardy . En general entretenida
"I dont know why the critics didnt like the movie, I loved it l, it was funny and had some awesome moments"
"Loved it! The right mix of Marvel's patented humor and seriousness. A little different from the comics, but it worked. I will definitely be seeing it again. Make sure you stay for the 2 post credit scenes."
I understand Venom a lot more!!! Action scenes were dope and the punchlines were Funny... definitely ready for 2
Tom Hardy killed it! Did a great job of making venom without Spiderman. Venom should definitely be in infinity war. Critics should read more comics and keep their yaps shut.
"I'm surprised Venom got so many terrible reviews from all the movie critics. It was full of stunning visuals, amusing and Tom Hardy is a ***** act. It was fun to watch Venom running solo without Spider-man. Excited for a sequel if there is one."
Great movie! Great cast! Best 10 spent this year!!
I can't wait for the sequel.
"I have heard that the comic books can be a little bit more thriller and stronger, like a harsher strong coffee that puts hair on your chest. However, for a movie and the first introduction of Venom in todays time for today's people who may or may not have read the comics I think it was a great introduction. It had just enough humor but a lot of action along with introducing Venom and a way for others to understand a bit of the backstory. It definitely gave me some good laughs but it had a serious side as well. I sense a sequal, which in this case would be a good thing, I want to know and see more."
This movie is a lot better than reviews say it bar heck to all the reviews that gave this movie a 30% and made it seem like trash when it was so much better I know what venom would call these people that gave the review and it's what he call Eddie right before he gets in the elevator so heck all 10 of my friends that I went to see it with said it was amazing and deserves love so go watch it cuz dumb review people said not to but go watch it cuz you wanna make your own opinion and have a good time can't wait for hopefully a part 2
LOVED IT!! TONS OF ACTION! FUNNY! WILL SEE IT AGAIN!!!!
"Wished it was owned by Disney and tied to the MCU, but decent movie."
"This movie was fantastic from start to finish. Do not listen to the reviews, go see it for yourself!"
"I think people got it wrong when they entered their reviews, yeah it dragged on the origins and action sequences of Venom but they certainly had me on the edge of my seat! I loved it! It was sick!"
"I really liked it, had action good story line and some parts were funny"
"A++ flick. Funny, but still a great action Marvel movie. Bring on the sequel!"
Excellent movie don't listen to the reviews. I would pay to see it again.
It's okay
It was very funny!
Non stop action and laughs venom was awesome
Will definitely go see this again and can't wait for the release to OD on the Blu-ray
"This movie kept me interested from beginning to end. Lots of action, but easy to follow even if you know nothing about Venom. MarvelSony doesnt disappoint. The special effects were great and Venoms voice and humor were just right. I took my 8 year old son , who is a big Marvel fan, and he said it was intense. I had to Google some history and the movie doesnt exactly follow the comics so if youre into the comics, try not to be critical. Cant wait until the next movie- make sure you wait for the post credits scenes!"
I will see this movie again! Did not disappoint.
A lot of action and funny we loved it hoping for a second movie
The only reason I ****** was because Tom Hardy was in it...other wise quite disappointing. The special effects were disturbing and somewhat childish.
Awesome *** movie!!!!
One of the best Marvel movies.
"Listen, it's not Oscar worthy, and no one should go into it thinking that it will be. The only reason it gets 4 stars instead if 5 for me, was because the first 30 minutes was choppy and seemed like they cut much longer scenes super short. Tom Hardy basically ****** it like the love story that it is. Go see it, and enjoy. You will be entertained."
can't wait for the next part of venom to come out!
"Bad. Horrid. Awful. Etc. Not the usual Ferrel & Reilly fun laugh. Worse than Dewey ***, if that's even possible."
I love these guys but this one was a swing and a miss.
"I'm a big fan of both Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly, so what could possibly go wrong here....? I'll tell you...... this movie was virtually unwatchable from start to finish. I'm trying now to recall a scene that actually dragged a laugh out of me and I'm drawing a blank. It was an hour and a half of my life I'll never get back and if given the choice between watching this again or burning my intestines out, I'll be chugging Draino..... Some big names really took a beating by appearing in this cack..... Ralph Fiennes, what were you thinking? Hugh Laurie, have a word with yourself. Mr. Ferrell,pick a hat. I'll gladly take a dump in it for you, and if anyone knows Reilly's address, please forward it to me, as I have a bag of dicks with his name on. Rant over."
These two actors have chemistry but the story was so bad. Oh well better luck next time.
"Unfortunately, this movie was one of the worst I have ever seen. We walked out halfway through the movie and I have only done that once before at the movie Fireproof with Kirk Cameron. The trailer was deceiving. The humor was crude, boring and in no way funny. The actors in this movie should be embarrassed. I could go on, but I will stop now..."
"Nothing was funny about this movie, Sherlocks Holmes is not supposed to be funny, he's supposed to be smart and a detective that gets down to the case, not to make people laugh! They put new school stuff that has been happening now days and I trying to make you think it happened in the old days ??They should of made another step brothers sequel with those 2 not this kind of movie! ???????? They wouldn't let me post this with zero stars"
Ive walked out of one movie in my life...The Crying Game...this was number two. Flat the hour I suffered.
"I had high expectation! But this is the worst movie, I've ever paid to see! It had Left leaning political hits. Talladega Nights was memorable movie that both these actors starred in, and people still laugh and talk about. I would suggest these guys, back up and regroup!"
"Having lived it , seeing something that took 10 years to make I can't believe it. Save your money."
Poorly developed story line. Was looking forward to this movie but it fell short..... way short. Wait for Netflix.
"Travolta was great in this movie, but the movie was horrible. Don't waste your time go watch it on amazon Firestick they have a great copy"
Easily the worst mafia movie Ive ever seen. Nevertheless I still liked it. So many random scenes that felt like it had nothing to do with anything. John travolta is basically the worst actor in history of humanity. If you dont know anything about the mafia then you will pretty much have no clue what is happening the entire time. Your enjoyment will be limited to ****** Long Island accents and aggressive insults that seem completely uncalled for.
Easily the worst mob movie of all time. Usually even bad movies have some redeeming features...not Gotti. An eyesore. Avoid.
I was able to follow its bouncing around because I'm very familiar with the Gotti case. The people around me had no clue.
Hated it. The trailer looked like it would be entertaining. Awful to think this movie is based upon a real person. So sad.
"I went into this movie thinking it was going to be as good, if not better than Goodfellas, but I was hugely disappointed. It was worse than Corky Romano, and Mickey Blue Eyes. This movie missed the mark in every way possible, from the storyline to the acting. It was all over the place, and definitely not in the right place."
"Ok So This Film Is Getting Hate For No Reason. Not The Greatest Film, Only Complaint I Had Was It Jumped Around Years A Little Too Much. But Other Than That, Travolta Was Great. I Thought The Music Was Good And It Was A Good Gangster Flick That's Different From The Rest. Do Yourself A Favor Don't Listen To The Critic's And See It For Yourself."
"Throw your money in the garbage instead of going to this movie. This will at least save you 2 hours of your life. It was a horrible film that jumped around (and not in a good Quentin Tarantino way). Everything about it sucked, including Travolta. The ONLY good thing was the soundtrack but who goes to a movie for that. If you're a huge fan of mafia films stay home and watch Godfather or Goodfellas for the 20th time. You'll enjoy it infinitely more. Do not waste your time seeing this piece of ****."
The movie was very disappointing ! The documentary that has been on A& E is much better told by John Jr. than the movie. The movie is a repeat with movie stars trying to portray the family ! I want my money back.....
"But even Travolta and company messed this up! All they had to do was follow Sopranos and Goodfellas, but instead made this mess of a movie. If I could give it 0 stars I would."
SPOILERS ALERT Through out the movie it was very enjoyable and very cute with the two main characters. As a reader of many books similar to this and watching movies related to this I have never experienced such a sad scene with such emotional value to it. The main character Katie has XP and was in love with Charlie who later became her boyfriend. At the end however Katie was exposed to sunlight resulting in a soon sad death which was very heartbreaking for the viewers who were emotionally attracted to the characters during the movie. This was why I rated it one star for this sad ending which was extraordinarily sad and unacceptable.
Ok so i stan bella hardcorde!! Like LOVE BELLA... but sis this movie SUCKed so bad!! Who let you be in this movie??
This was a bad movie. No one in my family enjoyed it.
"When you are the only one in the theater, that should indicate how successful (or lack thereof) a movie is. I tried my hardest to like this but truly a waste of my Movie Pass and 90 mins. McCarthy can always find a way to make something watchable and she is literally the only one worth paying attention too. The puppets were trying to hard to be offensive and foul and it didn't work. There is two crude scenes with puppets and *** but I couldn't even chuckle, just stupid."
This was by far one of the worst movies Melissa McCarthy has ever made. It was crude and raunchy. Normally I am fairly open minded but I have kids that are begging to see this and even at 17 I would not watch this with children of any age. I did not like this movie.
Literally the only scene that was funny was the scene in the previews. Really surprised thought it would've been a lot better
"There's a big difference raunchy humor and crude, humorless attempt at jokes. Jist cursing and making sexual jokes that don't land does not an edgy movie makes."
What can I say. I was pretty disappointed. It just wasn't that funny.
Horrible movie totally sucked

"Over the top vulgar. It was **** with foul language. Well because they were puppets they could do anything. Some funny parts, but because it was so vulgar it was disappointing."
I wish I could give this move no stars. It was so boring with your mama quality jokes. Left after less than an hour
This was the worst kind awful movie because every once in a while you get a glimpse of everything this movie could've been. Resist the urge to leap up and leave when the main movie ends...
"If you're able to take raunchy and regular Melissa McCarthy humor, as a night-out movie this ain't so bad. There surprisingly is a story to follow and the jokes keep the movie chugging. Then again, sometimes the jokes overpower the actual story and make me forget what's even happening in the scene. For sure not a family movie, don't think that *maybe* you can bring your kids to this. A puppet screws another puppet in his office and then ********** all over it for 30 seconds straight. Recommend watching with another person to alleviate the boredom and cringe you'll endure, and to elevate the fun time you'll have watching this movie."
"There were a few laughs, but this is a genuinely bad movie. Save yourself! It's too late for me!"
Probably the worst movie I have ever seen..hands down. I respect the actors/actresses less for staring in this movie. Not even funny
This movie fell short of being funny because its crude and vulgar attempt at comedy overshadowed the humor.
Wasn't really what I expected. I was going in expecting a lot of funny over the top moments but they were just average at best the *** stuff was kind of dumb and McCarthy is same character as always wish I'd seen almost anything else.
DONT WASTE UR MONEY ON THIS TRASH OF A FILM!!!! WAT A PILE OF LOWLIFE TRASH!!!! CANT BELIEVE SOMEONE WOULD MAKE TRASH LIKE THIS AND FIND SOMEONE TO ACT IN IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"Movie was just ok. Some funny sights but not anywhere as funny as I expected. Movie more serious than anticipated, which didn't really help make it better."
"Had some funny parts but overall crass, vulgar & disgusting."
This movie was not for me. Hated it and walked out 10 minutes into the show.
"Would give negative stars if possible. There is nothing redeeming about this movie, not even Melissa M. Can't believe she agreed to be in it"
this movie is for dumb people with a really bad sense of humor. it amazed me that people in the theater were laughing at this god awful movie. I wish I had never seen this movie it was boring and totally unfunny.
Don't even consider this movie. It is horrible. I walked out and felt like I needed a bath. I don't understand why anyone spent money to even make this disgusting mess.
"Cool puppet work and raunchy at some points, but overall didn't hold my interest and rarely laughed out loud even with very low expectations."
"Very disappointed with this movie, had a total of like 5 funny scenes and that includes the last ones. I wouldn't recommend it unless you enjoy obnoxious jokes that a 6th grader could come up with, if so then this movie is for you. They could have done more with this movie but oh well I guess you win some, you lose some."

Thought it would've been just as uniquely funny of a child theme turned adult as ted. Very very few parts deserved even a chuckle. Overall it was the most disappointed I've ever been in a movie...
"The previews showed the only good parts of the movie. The movie was EXPLICITLY commenting on race relations between Blacks and Whites in this country. I thought at first it was just another movie that portrayed the struggles of General UNDERDOGS, but in the beginning when the puppet was singing and dancing “for the man” the movie took a turn. After the private eye rescued the puppet he told him that he didn't have to do that anymore. THE PUPPET REPLIED THAT HE LOVED SINGING AND DANCING FOR THE MAN! What in the ENTIRE ****! There were other suspect scenes like the puppet who couldn't get a cab. It was horrible. I didn't pay money to watch one group be humiliated and stepped on. And don't bring up the fact that the sergeant in charge was the African American STANLEY FROM THE OFFICE. There's ALWAYS AN UNCLE TOM WHO WILL SELL OUT THEIR OWN. This movie was awful"

Stupid. Boring. Annoying.
"I felt like walking out of the movie, and wished we gone seen another movie. Melissa used all those lines and actions in her other movies. The comedy was just not there. No star here at all."
I sure thought based on the previews this movie was going to be hilarious. Sadly the previews was all that was funny in the movie. Wait for Netflix!!
This is so unoriginal with simpleton **** humor. Awful. Not clever or funny at all.
"It kept getting compared to 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' and I love that movie, so gave this a chance and was terribly disappointed. Not only is there a lot that is really crude and disgusting, but there seemed to be no purpose to it other than to be as gross as possible. The story was lacking and most of the 'jokes' aren't really funny. Maya Rudolph as the Girl Friday is honestly the bright spot of the whole movie but doesn't get enough screen time."
"I was very much anticipating this movie, unfortunately what I watched was two separate movies. The movie that was Batman vs. Superman was great! However when they tried to force set up for the upcoming Justice League movies that's when it felt shoved in and out of place. Ben Affleck was an amazing replacement for Bale's batman. The fight was great though short and the set up to it was head scratchily confusing. Above all, few moments of really entertaining stuff but a big disappointment!"
"This movie de-edifys and slanders people and organizations, not based of beliefs, principles, and morals. But off a political standpoint. Just at total shame"
"Acting was good however storyline, direction and even music did not flow. Timing of cartoons, flashbacks and cut away segments of wild animals were just strange. It seemed like an epic film that threw in the kitchen sink of any cinematic element. Almost walked out but was hoping it would get better - it never did."
"This movie was awful, we struggled to watch it for 45 minutes in the hope it got better it didnt. Total disappointment on Christmas Day! We werent the only ones who got up and walked out. Only giving it one star as we have to!"
It starts put pretty funny but then just get fumb. It doesn't really go anywhere. I was very disappointed.
"Norm of the North didn't strike me as a great movie. The character didn't really fit into the role and the writing was less than good. The characters themselves didn't really seem to have any sense of urgency. The animation was the only good thing I can take away from this and the visuals, but other than that, it wasn't really a movie that I find amazing or enjoyed. Norm of the North is good for kids, though, so if you're a kid looking for a movie to go to, this probably is your movie. Not a great movie, unfortunately."
"This movie is awful. I wish I could unsee it, but honestly, I walked out with my younger son halfway through because he just couldn't take it anymore. We had to wait around for my other son and wife, but they did not enjoy it. Don't waste your time / money."
"I've never written a movie review before. But after watching this movie, I just had to. Yes, I read all the bad reviews but my six year old still wanted to see it. All the reviews were spot on. The story is poorly written and this movie was so boring that both my daughter and I were fighting to stay awake. The only reason I'm rating two versus one star is that my daughter still said she liked it. If we had watched this on our couch, we'd probably still be in our boredom induced nap."
"The movie as so out of Character for De Niro and the disgusting language of was so filthy that we got up and left during the scene where his grandson came to pick him up for a trip and found him masterbating. The movie, from what i could tell from the beginning was going to be ****. This if not a movie for a chid or descent adult. I don't recommend it for any age. Sorry that I wasted my money in taking the ride to the theater to even try to see it."
"Very poor, unimaginative humor and a film completely devoid of any redeeming value. The actors should be ashamed to have appeared in this worthless film. Boring and excruciating. I wouldn't take $100 to sit through it again. Save your money and watch your neighbor's dog take a sh*t!"
"Silly, sophomoric and shocking but parts had me doubled over from laughing . Aubrey Plaza was hysterical as the dry humored, honey grandpa chaser... She was the funniest in the cast. Zac Efron shocked me with his singing talent....he has it all....looks, physique and now a great voice... He really is maturing into a great comedic actor. De Niro was perfect in his part even though some of his filthy rankings could have been cut shorter, he did the job perfectly. I definitely would recommend this for a girls night out movie...not for a first date or a movie night out with your kid."
"Should have known better than to see this on a holiday. Depressing, obnoxious, filthy and pretty boring even though Thornton and Bates are absolutely great actors. Didn't see Bad Santa 1, ....and I would never have seen this one if I had!!!"
"Entirely too much foul language. Mostly unnecessary. It would have been just as funny without most of it. Didn't like the mother being mistreated, slapped. The whole ""mother involvement"" was not a good story line. Left a bad taste. I'm good with the *** though LOL!"
"Overly sexulised, too much effort to make it funny, no respect for women,..."
Don't waste your $ unless you absolutely have NOTHING to do. And when I say nothing I mean ... NOTHING.
"This movie is awful. The filmwork Is terrible. Anything but creative, filmed like a straight to video movie. Big fan of Rob Zombie but his creativity is running dry and the product is cheap. I don't know whether the movie is action or horror but I do know it was awful. Stay away."
Are you kidding me Zombie?! Awful.
The storyline is very poorly executed...all they did is throw all the characters from Z1 and made them appear randomly on screen. I didn t even know what I saw when I came out. In terms of laughing...there is literally none! Very lame and almost forced jokes. Again a couple of funny moments came through but only because they referenced it from the first movie. Just aweful don't even bother! ZERO STARS. And I never write reviews but made an account specifically for this one. Sad that they even waste money making this kind of s***t.
"As a big fan of the original Zoolander, I was very disappointed in the sequel. The story was difficult to follow, and the writing just want good. I left the theater early because it was so bad."
"I really, really wanted to believe that this movie was going to hit it out of the park. I refused to believe all of the bad reviews. But after seeing it, I have to agree. It just tried too hard :/ In addition, the plot was actually pretty confusing and disjointed. It didn't flow. It had some funny parts, but it missed the mark. I wish that wasn't the case!"
Probably fun for the actors and cameo celebs to make... Painful to watch. Tell me the same joke again and again and again.
This movie was garbage in my opinion. It was offensive and didn't make any sense. I was ready to leave 30 minutes in. So annoyed I paid for this
I really liked the movie. Had a lot of great characters and I loved the fact that the family was from my home town Chicago.
"Mike was Mike and he always does well, but this movie was drawn out and full of too many people trying to be comedians instead of actors. Plus the story line was a sleeper halfway through the movie. This should of been a straight to DVD venture."
2 hours of my life I will never get back. I gave it one star only because I think it started off good.
"An elementary level movie. Annoying characters ,bad acting and basic scripting. The worst."
"The science in the movie didn't make sense and there were so many scenes that new more emotion. The Evan character was a cliche that we seen in movies like this which was extremely disappointing. Although this movie had a good idea to it, it was poorly produced in the making. The plot could have been guessed half an hour into it and it also did not make sense"
When a movie is based off of a book then it should be as close to the book as possible. Warning to anyone who has read the book DO NOT WATCH THE MOVIE.m.
Saturday afternoon and I had nothing better to do. I wasn't a bad movie but not something I would recommend to my friends. The preview really builds this one up but I left feeling like the target audience is more for the early teenager. Acting is what you would expect from inexperienced staff....and that goes for the directing and writing as well.
Pretty much like the Hunger Games and Divergent. Not original at all. Plot was simple and easy to figure out. It's ****.
